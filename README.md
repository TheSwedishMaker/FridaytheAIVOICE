# FridaytheAIVOICE
A voice to voice AI-Assistant based on chatGPT

My attempt at a voice controlled AI assistant. Based on code from: https://github.com/Ascensao/python_chatGPT_voice


Currently all the API-code is included inside the python-script. This needs to be placed elsewhere 
for security reasons. I havent had time to do so. 

To install 

clone repo https://github.com/TheSwedishMaker/FridaytheAIVOICE

install requirements 

```bash
cd FridaytheAIVOICE
```

run script: 

```bash
python3 jarvis_gpt.py
```
